# Coin Toss

This is a basic guess game, very similar to the rock, paper, scissors game previously created. The main difference is that this guessing game uses jQuery as the main library from JavaScript. Code is much simpler ans shorter in comparison to just using vanilla JavaScript. 

The user must make a selection of "head" or "tails" by clicking a button. The on click function initiates by generating a random selection. If the uses guesses the same option as the random selection then the win counter will add one, else, the loss counter adds one. The game also keeps track of how many times the user has selected head and tails. 

## Technology Used

This web base application uses the jQuery library and BootStrap for the layout and CSS.
